# RISC V Processor in Verilog

## Overview
This repository contains a RISC V Pipelined Processor Implementation in Verilog along with various testbenches to validate its functionality. The processor supports basic arithmetic and control instructions.

## Features
- **Pipelined Architecture** with 5 stages namely Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execution (EXE), Memory (MEM) and Write Back (WB).
- **ALU Operations**: Add, Sub, AND, OR, Branch, etc.
